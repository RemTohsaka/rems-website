Rem is a developer, writer, and artist. She studied Applied Mathematics at the undergraduate and graduate level at The University of Akron. Her thesis investigated machine learning interventions to counter color perception distortions inherent in digital imagery. Specifically, novel color constancy algorithms using convolution neural networks yielded improved results from existing algorithms. This work later served as the basis of an iPad app to aid color blind individuals.
 
Professionally, Rem began in Silicon Valley at the ed-tech startup, Udacity. There she learned product-first engineering and design, receiving mentorship from tech's leading senior engineers. Part of her role at Udacity involved engineering solutions for content and culture moderation for student services.
 
Seeking a more mathematically rigorous venture, Rem transitioned to Barnstorm Research where she served as a Senior Scientist. Her primary responsibilities included technical writing specific to natural language processing, deep learning, and statistics. Additionally, she served as a Tensorflow developer on several contracts that utilized large language models to interpret and identify trends in research corpora. Another language learning model sought to develop a chat based game for professional standard operating procedure training. This project incorporated novel syntheses between generative adversarial networks (GANs) and planners. Work from this project then led to a paper where Rem was listed as a co-author.
 
Lately, Rem is developing solutions for The Cleveland Orchestra. Her research and writing interests lie at the intersections of ethics, artificial general intelligence, and personality development.
